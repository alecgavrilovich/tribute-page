          <strong>Milutin Milanković</strong> <small>(Милутин Миланковић, 28 May 1879 – 12 December 1958)</small> was a Serbian mathematician,
          astronomer, climatologist, geophysicist, civil engineer, doctor of technology, university professor and
          popularizer of science. Milanković gave two fundamental contributions to global science. The first
          contribution is the <span>Canon of the Earth’s Insolation</span>, which characterizes the climates of all the
          planets of the Solar system. The second contribution is the explanation of Earth's long-term climate
          changes caused by changes in the position of the Earth in comparison to the Sun, now known as <span>Milankovitch
           cycles (11 Ice Ages)</span>. This explained the <span>ice ages</span> occurring in the geological past of the Earth, as well
           as the <span>climate changes</span> on the Earth which can be expected in the future.
